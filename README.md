### Overview
Gratis is a versatile framework designed to promote the separation of concerns, fostering scalable code practices by encapsulating logic within listeners. Primarily tailored for creating robust and scalable APIs, the framework follows a *REST-like* architectural style. It seamlessly interacts with SQL databases, providing a structured and efficient foundation for building web applications.

```
The code structure is designed to follow a clear separation of concerns, distinguishing between *model* and *controller* components.

- **Controllers:** Responsible for handling HTTP requests, controllers in the API interact with the backend logic, facilitating seamless communication with the front end.

- **Models:** Empowered to perform database I/O, models enforce a strictly typed database schema. This ensures robust data integrity and reliability.

This framework is tailored to collaborate seamlessly with static files generated by modern front-end frameworks, such as **Vue.js**. Due to this focus, there is no need for explicit *views*, streamlining the development process and fostering a modular and scalable architecture.
