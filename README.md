### Overview
Gratis is a versatile framework designed to promote the separation of concerns, fostering scalable code practices by encapsulating logic within handlers. Primarily tailored for creating robust and scalable APIs, the framework follows a *REST-like* architectural style. It seamlessly interacts with SQL databases, providing a structured and efficient foundation for building web applications.

<br />

### Installing Dependencies
The only dependency used in this framework is **PHPUnit** for development testing. In order to install **PHPUnit**
as well as generate autoload files, run the following,
```bash
composer update
```
```bash
composer install
```

<br />

### Running The **PHPUnit** Test Suite
In order to the run the automated test suite for this framework, execute,
```bash
composer test
```
or see the **GitHub Actions** tab.

### Intended Structure
```text
│
└── src/
    ├── Models/
    │ └── ...

    ├── Controllers/
    │ └── ...
    │
    └── ...
```
The code structure is designed to follow a clear separation of concerns, distinguishing between *model* and *controller* components.

- **Controllers:** Responsible for handling HTTP requests, controllers in the API interact with the backend logic, facilitating seamless communication with the front end.

- **Models:** Empowered to perform database I/O, models enforce a strictly typed database schema. This ensures robust data integrity and reliability.

This framework is tailored to collaborate seamlessly with static files generated by modern front-end frameworks, such as **Vue.js**. Due to this focus, there is no need for explicit *views*, streamlining the development process and fostering a modular and scalable architecture.
