### Overview
Gratis is a versatile framework designed to promote the separation of concerns,
fostering scalable code practices by encapsulating logic within handlers.
Primarily tailored for creating robust and scalable APIs that follow the **CRUD** lifecycle, the framework follows a *REST-like* architectural style.
It seamlessly interacts with **SQL** databases, providing a structured and efficient foundation for building web applications.

<br />

### Intended Structure
```text

└── src/
    ├── Models/
    │ └── ...

```
The code structure is designed to follow a clear separation of concerns, distinguishing between *model*, *controller*, and *middleware* components.

- #### Middlewares
  First to have access to client *request* and *response* objects before they are handled by a controller. This makes them perfect for handling tasks such as client verification as well as cross-origin resource sharing.


- #### Controllers
  Responsible for handling HTTP requests, controllers in the API interact with the backend logic, facilitating seamless communication with the front end.


- #### Models
  Empowered to perform database I/O, models enforce a strictly typed database schema. This ensures robust data integrity and reliability.


This framework is tailored to collaborate seamlessly with static files generated by modern front-end frameworks, such as **Vue.js**. Due to this focus, there is no need for explicit *views*, streamlining the development process and fostering a modular and scalable architecture.
